        <p>SSG is the process of Static generation similar to I wanna say cretbot but it won't work for me.
            It outputs a bunch of static files such as HTML Javascript and CSS. You can have these stay static
            while they pull data from it and make an html page. Additionally you can keep them static but still pull
            the data from the page. example:
        </p>
        <h1>getStaticProp</h1>
        <h1>getSeverSideProps</h1>
        <p>If getStaticProp is used this will fetch data while the file is being built. Leaving the page to remain static.
            While getSeverSideProps will automatically know what the app requires to build it. The next step to easily do this 
            is to use Next.js. So to begin you first need to open a new project you wish this to go into and run
        </p>
        <h1>npx create-next-app my-static-nextjs-app</h1>
        <p> This will install Next.js to allow you to start your begin with your static generation. The next step is to navigate to
            the folder its in. And then start your deployment server.
        </p>
        <h1>cd my-static-nextjs-app</h1>
        <h1>npm run dev</h1>
        <p> Once the following steps are completed go to http://localhost:3000. This is the start to your static server. If you run the build it
            will return a bunch of API. So have fun and experiment with what their is to do. SSG allows us to statically compile an app. Once you finish
            and compile by connecting your files to Next.js it will look exactly how you want it. So good luck and have fun!
